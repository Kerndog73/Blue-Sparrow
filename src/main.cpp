// Multiplayer?

// Code
//   Should we abandon entt::each?
//   Move constants into one place
//     1500 milliseconds is one example
//     there are a lot of them

// Objects
//   Turrets
//     Should beacons shoot?
//     Activation
//       shooting (same as beacons)
//       spending coins (gives coins a use beyond upgrading)
//     Killing enemies gives the killer coins, ammo and hull
//     Coins can be used to activate turrets
//     When turrets destroy ships, the coins either go nowhere or are stored in the turret
//     Turrets can be destroyed
//     Maybe they give coins to the killer?

// UI
//   Minimap
//     Should include the status of the beacons
//     Show allies
//     Show enemies that are visible to player or allies
//     Indicate whether beacons are being attacked
//   Should the health bar of a beacon indicate ally/enemy/neutral?
//   Left panel should be hidden and revealed to cover the game view
//   Show missile target lock

// Game mechanics
//   Winning and losing
//   Respawning
//   Healing over time
//   Maybe the ability to grab onto asteroids and move them around
//   A signal to send to team mates
//     e.g. "come help me" or "go destroy that thing" or "go defend that thing"
//   Don't drop items on death. Give items to whoever dealt the final blow

// AIs
//   (for the different roles of a team)
//   Avoiding walls (missiles should do this)
//   Dodging (missiles should do this)
//   Picking up drops
//   Defending
//   Guarding
//   Attacking
//   High level AI
//     We have behaviours (seek and orbit) that define an immediate goal
//     We have levels that define how well the immediate goal is reached
//     We need some way of switching between behaviours dynamically
//     Example:
//       if there are no nearby targets, wander around
//       if a target is spotted, engage in the target
//   Can/should we separate aiming behaviours from moving behaviours?

// Drops
//   AIs that seek out drops
//   Drops for each team maybe?
//   Drops only for the player maybe?
//   Currently, drops are accidently picked up by other ships
//   Perhaps drops could spawn in a few places
//     Similar to TF2

// Controls
//   Should we move away from digital controls and use analog controls?
//     Would make AIs a little bit more effective
//     AIs can take full advantage of it but players only get improved aiming
//     Might help improve aim assist for the player

// Weapons
//   Drop mines that only effect the enemy
//     Perhaps fancy mines could have tiny blasters on them
//     Disappear after a while
//   Pulsing laser
//     Bouncing the laser off of mirrors could provide some interesting gameplay
//   Area of effect weapons (e.g. bombs)
//   Smart drones that can be spawned and shoot
//   Dumb drones that spin around and shoot
//   Missiles that shoot
