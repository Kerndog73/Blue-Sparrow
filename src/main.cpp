// Code
//   Should we abandon entt::each?

// Objects
//   Turrets
//     Should beacons shoot?

// UI
//   Might need a minimap
//     Should include the status of the beacons
//   Should the health bar of a beacon indicate ally/enemy/neutral?

// Game mechanics
//   Winning and losing
//   Respawning
//   Healing over time
//   Maybe the ability to grab onto asteroids and move them around

// AIs
//   (for the different roles of a team)
//   Avoiding walls (missiles should do this)
//   Dodging (missiles should do this)
//   Picking up drops
//   Defending
//   Guarding
//   Attacking
//   AIs should only target the player if they can actually see the player
//     shooting the player from way across the map is really unfair

// Drops
//   AIs that seek out drops
//   Drops for each team maybe?
//   Drops only for the player maybe?
//   Currently, drops are accidently picked up by other ships
//   Perhaps drops could spawn in a few places
//     Similar to TF2

// Controls
//   Should we move away from digital controls and use analog controls?
//     Would make AIs a little bit more effective
//     AIs can take full advantage of it but players only get improved aiming
//     Might help improve aim assist for the player

// Weapons
//   Drop mines that only effect the enemy
//     Perhaps fancy mines could have tiny blasters on them
//   Pulsing laser
//     Bouncing the laser off of mirrors could provide some interesting gameplay

// CMake
