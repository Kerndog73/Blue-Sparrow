// Objects
//   Turrets
//     Should beacons shoot?

// AIs
//   (for the different roles of a team)
//   Dodging (missiles that dodge)
//   Picking up drops
//   Defending
//   Guarding
//   Attacking

// Drops
//   AIs that seek out drops
//   Drops for each team maybe?
//   Drops only for the player maybe?
//   Currently, drops are accidently picked up by other ships
//   Perhaps drops could spawn in a few places
//     Similar to TF2

// Controls
//   Should we move away from digital controls and use analog controls?
//     Would make AIs a little bit more effective
//     AIs can take full advantage of it but players only get improved aiming
//     Might help improve aim assist for the player

//   Should it be possible to move laterally?
//     Would make it easier to move and aim at the same time
//     I still think controls should be relative to the ship
//       rather than relative to the world like they are in diep.io

// Weapons
//   Drop mines that only effect the enemy
//     Perhaps fancy mines could have tiny blasters on them
//   Pulsing laser
//     Bouncing the laser off of mirrors could provide some interesting gameplay
